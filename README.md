# When will it end

This consists of a single class `LoopProgressMonitor` that you instantiate right before a loop
and then call inside the loop. It monitors how long each iteration is taking and issues a forecast of when
the loop will conclude based on the number of iterations remaining and the average time per iteration so far.
It prints a new predicted end time only when the most recent forecast falls too far from its internal estimate 
modulo some tolerance.

DISCLAIMER: [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) is generally far superior to
 `when_will_it_end`. One possible exception is that `when_will_it_end` plays pretty well 
 with jupyter notebooks. The output is typically brief and consists of simple print statements. 
 

## Requirements

Python 3 with the following modules: `math`, `time`

## Setup

From pypi: `pip install when_will_it_end`

Alternatively, clone the [source](https://github.com/zkurtz/when_will_it_end) and
- `cd when_will_it_end`
- `python setup.py install`

## Example

```python
import numpy as np
import time
import when_will_it_end as wwie

number_of_iterations = 10

print('Starting time: ' + wwie.format_time(time.time()))

lpm = wwie.LoopProgressMonitor(n = number_of_iterations)
for k in range(number_of_iterations):
    lpm()
    _ = np.random.uniform(0,1,size=100000000)

print('Actual ending time: ' + wwie.format_time(time.time()))
```

Results:

```
Starting time: 18:04:42
Starting first of 10 iterations ...
Est. total 18.0 seconds, finish 18:05:00 after 9 iters at 1.8 sec/iter
Est. total 20.0 seconds, finish 18:05:02 after 6 iters at 2.0 sec/iter
Actual ending time: 18:05:01
```
